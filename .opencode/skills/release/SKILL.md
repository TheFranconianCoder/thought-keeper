description: Cut and publish a GitHub release for thought-keeper — preflight the branch, cross-build the binaries with the version stamped in, write the release notes, and create the tag plus release with gh.

# Release thought-keeper

Publish a new GitHub release from `main`. The three binaries are built locally and uploaded; **nothing
is committed and no tag is moved**.

## Preconditions

- `mise install` has run in the repository (Go, Node, Task, GitHub CLI).
- `gh auth login` has been done for `github.com`.
- The working tree is clean and `main` is level with `origin/main`.

## Steps

### 1. Inspect

From the repository root:

```bash
.opencode/skills/release/scripts/preflight.sh
.opencode/skills/release/scripts/changes.sh
```

`preflight.sh` reports branch, tree, authentication and the last tag; it exits non-zero and names
what is missing. `changes.sh` prints the commit range since the last tag and the commit subjects.

Read the output. If `preflight.sh` fails, fix the cause (push, commit, `gh auth login`) or stop and
tell the user — never work around it.

### 2. Choose the version

Ask the user for `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` unless they already gave one. If they did not, propose one from
the commit subjects (Conventional Commits): a breaking change → major, any `feat` → minor, otherwise
patch. State the proposal; do not publish a version the user has not confirmed.

### 3. Write the notes

Create the directory and write exactly two files:

- `.release/title.txt` — one line, the release title. No version prefix, no period, no Markdown.
- `.release/notes.md` — the release description in Markdown.

Rules:

1. **Title**: catchy but professional, e.g. `Refined Architecture & High-DPI Support`. No slang, no
   exclamation marks, no exaggeration.
2. **Description**: group the changes into categories — `Features`, `Fixes`, `Refactoring`,
   `Performance`, `Documentation` — and keep only the categories that apply.
3. **Content only.** No diff links, no commit hashes, no "see the full changelog", no thank-you filler.
4. **Do not invent changes.** Every bullet must come from the commit subjects you read in step 1.
5. **English.** All repository artifacts are English.
6. **User-facing.** Say what changed for the reader of the app, not which package was touched when
   the two differ.

Show the title and the notes to the user before publishing when the user asked to review them; a
plain "release it" authorizes step 4.

### 4. Publish

```bash
.opencode/skills/release/scripts/release.sh 1.2.3
```

The script re-runs the preflight, builds the PWA, cross-builds

- `dist/thought-keeper-linux-amd64`
- `dist/thought-keeper-linux-arm64`
- `dist/thought-keeper-windows-amd64.exe`

plus `dist/SHA256SUMS`, stamps `v1.2.3`/commit/build time into `internal/version` via `-ldflags`,
verifies the binary reports the tag, and runs `gh release create v1.2.3` with the tag pointing at
`HEAD`. On success it deletes `.release/`; on failure it keeps the notes so the same version can be
retried.

### 5. Verify

```bash
gh release view v1.2.3
```

Report the release URL and the asset list to the user.

## Rules

- **Never commit or push.** A release tags the commit that is already on `origin/main`; if the work
  is not committed yet, say so and stop.
- **Never delete, move or re-create an existing tag.** The preflight refuses a tag that exists.
- **Never publish from a dirty tree or a feature branch.**
- If the user only wants the notes, stop after step 3.
